questions from normalization to introtuction to sql 


1.what is normalization?
Normalization in Database Management Systems (DBMS) is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns 
to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. The main goal of normalization is to divide a database into smaller,
related tables to ensure that each piece of data is stored only once, eliminating the possibility of anomalies 
and inconsistencies.
2.various types of normalization levels?
1NF,2Nf,3NF
3.EXPLAIN each normal forms in databse

First Normal Form (1NF):

Ensure that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values, and each record is unique.
Remove repeating groups of data.
Second Normal Form (2NF):

Achieve 1NF.
Remove partial dependencies, where non-key attributes depend only on a part of the primary key. This applies to tables with composite keys.
Third Normal Form (3NF):

Achieve 2NF.
Remove transitive dependencies, where non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes rather than on the primary key.

4.explain partial dependency and trasitive dependency

A partial dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute (a column that is not part of any candidate key) is functionally 
dependent on part of a composite primary key, rather than on the whole key.
A transitive dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute is dependent on another non-prime attribute rather than directly 
on the primary key.


5.what is databse transaction

a database transaction is a sequence of operations or tasks performed on the database that are treated as a single, 
indivisible unit of work. The goal of a transaction is to ensure that the database remains in a consistent state, even in the face of errors, crashes, or concurrent operations.

6.explain ACID properties

Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully; if any operation fails, 
the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left unchanged.
Consistency: Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another, adhering to all rules,
 constraints, and triggers defined in the database schema.
Isolation: Ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from each other, meaning that intermediate states of a 
transaction are not visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed.
Durability: Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.


7.Explain transaction Lifecycle

Begin Transaction: The transaction starts.
Execute Operations: Various operations (such as read, write, update, or delete) are performed on the database.
Commit: If all operations are successful, the transaction is committed, and changes are permanently saved to the database.
Rollback: If any operation fails or an error occurs, the transaction is rolled back, undoing all changes made during the transaction.

 explain BEGIN-COMMIT,BEGIN-ROLLBACK
The BEGIN-COMMIT sequence is used to start and successfully complete a transaction.
The BEGIN-ROLLBACK sequence is used to start a transaction and undo any changes if something goes wrong.

 8.Different types of keys

Primary key,candidate key,foreign key,secondary key,unique key,alternate key

  9.constraints in SQL
PRimarykey constraint,forignkey constraint, notnull constraint,check constraint,unique key constraint

 10 What is diff bt FK and PK in SQL Server?  

Primary Key:
Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Cannot contain NULL values. 	
The primary key is the “one” side of a one-to-many relationship. It is the unique identifier for the “parent” table.

Foreign Key:
Establishes and enforces a link between two tables.
Ensures that a value in one table (the foreign key) corresponds to an existing value in another table (the primary key).
Can contain NULL values if the relationship is optional.
The foreign key is the “many” side of a one-to-many relationship. It is used to link the “child” table to the “parent” table.

 11 What are the indexes in SQL Server?

Clutered index,nonclustered index,Composite index,Unique index
